# Hometown
Global, collaborative iOS map app

## Instructions

The app's still in developer mode, not ready to be realeased yet, so just download, compile, and run directly onto a compatible device. Log in with any username, and the app will hook up to jyudel.yudel.com (my server) to download the global location data. You can interact with the app in three ways:

### Reading Locations

#### Map View

In the Map View, which opens up first, you see all the location data overlaid onto a standard MapKit map. The pins are color-coded by category. Tapping once brings up the name and user who submitted it, and tapping again brings you to an additional info screen.

#### AR View

By tapping through on the bottom, you can go to AR View, which will let you see nearby locations as AR objects overlaid around you as color-coded, auto-sized dots. Tapping one will take you to the same info screen as it would from the map.

### Tagging Locations

To "tag" your current location, click the target icon in the lower-right corner (from either view) and fill in the associated info. It'll be automatically sent to the server once you finish.

## Philosophy

The idea for Hometown came from thinking about the kind of intimate knowledge that people have of places. Personally, as someone who's lived in the same town all my life, I can tell you all about the fun, obscure, or just plain _weird_ spots: The abandoned soap factory, the best graffiti, all the shortcuts to the train tracks. 
And I wanted a platform to allow everyone to share that kind of knowledge. Something simple but powerful. I couldn't find anything sufficient, so I decided to build it. I hope you can enjoy it or make good use of it, and definitely pull if you want to fix/improve anything. This is very much still in Beta :)

## History

This app was designed for my senior exploration, a month-long period at the end of high school given seniors to explore their interests.
